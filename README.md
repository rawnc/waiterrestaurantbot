# waiterrestaurantbot
A bot in place of a waiter in a restaurant (in format json, aoraji waiterbot.json). A sample project I worked on while learning chatbot development with IBM Watson platform.

To use my bot, you can briefly use the ibm watson car assistant.

Or some other sample apps which are also available on github
